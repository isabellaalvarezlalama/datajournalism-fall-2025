# Re-drawing data visualizations

2. Changes Made:
   * I made the change from bars to a line chart to show the spikes as years went on because with bars it is easy to tell, but with a line chart it is clearer to see an upwards trend for me. 
   * I also eliminated the "famous" incidents because they made the data hard to understand as they were a different color and made everything gray seem less important and easy to
   ignore.
   * I finally added labels to each axis because even though it is clear and could be easily assumed, it is better to have it labeled.
   * If I had the accurate information I wouldve added the specific years along the x-axis, but I did not want to be innacurate, so I skipped it. I think this would have been a good step
     because without specific years it is harder to tell the progression of time.

  2. Changes Made:
     * The main change I made was switching it from a sline chart to a bar graph. I wanted this change because it was harder to compare the cheese vs. the pepperoni when each year was
       not next to eachother. I also think that the line was misleading and could have indicated that throughout the months of each year the average price decreased, though that could have been
       true, we do not have the information to know that or not. Therefore, I believed that individual bars for each style's yearly average was more digestable and clear.
     * I also added labels to each axis because even though it is clear and could be easily assumed, it is better to have it labeled.
     * I kept the colors so it would be easy to distinguis and I thought that everything else could have stayed as well, so I left it.
