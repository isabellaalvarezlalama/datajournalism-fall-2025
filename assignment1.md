# Critique of a data-driven story

[Snow Removal Troubles](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/parking-snow-removal-tow-1.3917747)

**_Clarity and Accuracy_**

* I did not believe that his central insight was immediately identifiable, but it was present in the article. For that reason, I would rate it a 3 on ta scale from 1-5. The headline of this article was "Don't want to get towed during snow removal operations? Avoid these streets. I did not believe this was exactly what the author wanted to say, but instead wanted to allow people to understand that parking in the wrong spot can result in their cars getting towed and why. 

* I would rate the data visualization a 0 out of 5 because there was supposed to be a working map of towing statistics, but it was not visibly available. However, I do not believe that it being unavailable hindered my ability to understand the data and its implications. 

* City data from 2015-2017 winters is the source the author cites. I believe that the data was accurate as it was taken from city data which should be accessible upon request at a city hall or something similar. However, the author does not write on how CBC went about retrieving city data beyond mentioning the fact it is city data, so there is room for skeptisism. Additonally, the author does not write any specifics about the city data such as the radius which the data was collected from, or about what is considered "heavy" snowfall. I would rate the data and information with it a 2 our of five regardless of it being accurate because as a reader I would like more information about what is being cited in what I am reading.

**_Quality_**

* I believe that the quality level of this article is a 4 out of 5. It is not perfect, but it is informative and allows readers to understand the issue at hand using data in a way that is digestable. It is more on the simple side, so it lacks details in some areas, but the story remains high quality because of its informational value. 

**_Type and Color_** 

* As i mentioned before, the graphics were not visible and could not see the map that was mentioned. However, I believe that the type (a map) was an effective, 5/5, way to demonstrate towing data around the city. But since I did not get to see anything else I cannot critique it in any way.

**_Creativity_** 

* I believe that this piece was necessary and the way that it was done was creative enought o draw people's attention. The headline feels almost like clickbait to me because the article does not mention streets to avoid, but it does promote an app to help figure out where to park on snowy days. I believe that the headline definitely draws people in and the story tells you what it needs to tell you, so I would rate it a 4 out of 5. I rate it a four because the headline is slightly misguiding, but the rest of the story is clear and simple so it is very effective that way 

# Pitch for Final Project 

_Brainstorm_:

1. What interesting question you want to answer
  * How does fan interaction impact an artist's success in breaking through into the music industry and how does fan interaction change as artists become more successful.
2. What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it 
  * I could collect general data about how fan interaction generally shifts throughout an artist's carreer based on success
  * I would also be willing to collect my own data on how much artists of different fame levels interact with their fans on social media and at live performances
  * I am also thinking of collecting my own data comparing fame levels of artists who have similar fan bases, music style, and time in the industry, but interact with fans differently. 
3. Why this story is timely now
  * I believe this story would be timely because right now in the music world, artists gain traction because of social media which is a main way artists interact with fans. Additionally, there is artists trying to break through by promoting their music by promising ineractions wiht fans which ultimately feeds into other issues like parasocialism. 
4. What types of people you could talk to for sources
  * As an avid concert goer, I have a lot of music-centered friends who interact with artists and have interacted with well-known artists since before they became famous
  * I could also reach out to smaller artists and ask them how they value fan interaction, how much they do it, and how they believe it impacts their growth in the industry 
6. Anything else important to know
  * It is important to know that social media is also a very large factor in artist growth right now, so when data is collected I have to keep that in mind
