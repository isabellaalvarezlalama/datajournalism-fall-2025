# DC Crime Data

**Interesting question:**
What is the precinct that handles the most crime? 

**Steps taken:** 

1. I downloaded the data set and opened it in Excel
2. I selected the entire data set and created a pivot table in a new worksheet
3. I dragged voting precinct to the rows section and offense to the values section
4. I finally sorted the rows by descending to figure out which precincts had the most offenses

**Answer:**
The D.C. precinct within one mile of AU's campus that handles the most crime is precinct 29 they have a count of 130 offenses. The precinct following is the 31st precinct with a 45 offense count.

# Final Project Data 

**[Link to original data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/spotify-global-streaming-data-2024/data?select=Cleaned_Spotify_2024_Global_Streaming_Data.csv)**

**Cleaning data:**
I did not take any steps to clean it because the data was already clean when I download it. When I downloaded it, it said that the data was already clean. I just double-checked to make sure that it was clean. 

**Interesting question:** 
My interesting question I decded to answer from this data set using a pivot table was which country does each artist have more streams from? I believe it would be newsworthy, especially in context of my final project question, because streaming numbers can directly affect what countries an artist goes for in an international tour, so the question at hand is very important and relevant. 

**Steps taken:** 

1. Finding data about my topic was difficult because a lot of it is locked behind subsciptions, but once I found it, I downloaded it into Excel and made sure it was clean data like it said it once
2. I then took the usual steps to create a pivot table to attempt and answer my question
3. To answer the question, I dragged artists and countries into the rows section. I then dragged total streams into the values category. Finally, I sorted the table by the total streams in decending order which allowed me to see in what country each had most streams in

**Answer:** 
Since there is a lot of artists on the list, I will just answer for a few. Ariana Grande's country with most streams is Brazil, Billie Eilish's country with most streams is South Africa, Olivia Rodrigo's country with most streams is Russia, Taylor Swift's country with most streams is Germany, and Dua Lipa's country with most streams is South Korea.
