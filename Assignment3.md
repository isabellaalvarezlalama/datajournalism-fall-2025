# DC Crime Data

**Interesting question:**
What is the precinct that handles the most crime? 

**Steps taken:** 

1. I downloaded the data set and opened it in Excel
2. I selected the entire data set and created a pivot table in a new worksheet
3. I dragged voting precinct to the rows section and offense to the values section
4. I finally sorted the rows by descending to figure out which precincts had the most offenses

**Answer:**
The D.C. precinct within one mile of AU's campus that handles the most crime is precinct 29 they have a count of 130 offenses. The precinct following is the 31st precinct with a 45 offense count.

# Final Project Data 

**[Link to original data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/spotify-global-streaming-data-2024/data?select=Cleaned_Spotify_2024_Global_Streaming_Data.csv)**

**Cleaning data:**
I did not take any steps to clean it because the data was already clean when I download it. When I downloaded it, it said that the data was already clean. I just double-checked to make sure that it was clean. 

**Interesting question:** 
My interesting question I decded to answer from this data set using a pivot table was which country does each artist have more streams from? I believe it would be newsworthy, especially in context of my final project question, because streaming numbers can directly affect what countries an artist goes for in an international tour, so the question at hand is very important and relevant. 

**Steps taken:** 

1. Finding data about my topic was difficult because a lot of it is locked behind subsciptions, but once I found it, I downloaded it into Excel and made sure it was clean data like it said it once
2. I then took the usual steps to create a pivot table to attempt and answer my question
3. To answer the question, I dragged artists and countries into the rows section. I then dragged total streams into the values category. Finally, I sorted the table by the total streams in decending order which allowed me to see in what country each had most streams in

**Answer:** 
Since there is a lot of artists on the list, I will just answer for a few. Ariana Grande's country with most streams is Brazil, Billie Eilish's country with most streams is South Africa, Olivia Rodrigo's country with most streams is Russia, Taylor Swift's country with most streams is Germany, and Dua Lipa's country with most streams is South Korea. 

# Story Research 

There have been stories written about how local streaming can directly impact where an artist can tour. It has been done large-scale with large research budgets with large companies like Billboard. [Link](https://view.ceros.com/luminate-data/luminate-film-tv-report-2023-1/p/1) There is also a lot of research done about different tours' revenue and which tours are top selling of different years. [Link tour revenue](https://www.accio.com/business/top-selling-concert-tours) [Link top selling tours](https://soundcharts.com/blog/mechanics-of-touring) There are also general articles about hwo touring works, which is great background knowledge to have when approaching the topic. [Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742013/). I am aiming to find the correlation of how streaming impacts touring and viceversa. I cannot find anything about the correlation, and I am sure I could do more digging - but as of right now I haven't found anything of te exact thing I am trying to find. However, I can use a lto fo the stuff I already mentioned to find what I need. 

[Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/spotify-global-streaming-data-2024/data?select=Cleaned_Spotify_2024_Global_Streaming_Data.csv) This data seems trust worthy because there is a lot of data that just would make sense. As a music listener who is a big fan of these artists, the information checks out. I also know because on the Kaggle platform creators provide explanations for their data and people can comment leaving reviews. 

[Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gayu14/taylor-concert-tours-impact-on-attendance-and) This data is trusworthy because the platform shows the author and how they collected the data. This data is scraped from information from one specific tour -- the Eras Tour -- which allows less room for error since it covers a smaller range of data. 

[Dataset 3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/spotify-global-streaming-data-2024/code) The good thing about this dataset is that there si transparecy fro the author about it being sythetically generated using real-world references. This could help me model data or compare other data as well.
