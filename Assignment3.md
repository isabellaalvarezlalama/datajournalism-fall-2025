# DC Crime Data

**Interesting question:**
What is the precinct that handles the most crime? 

**Steps taken:** 

1. I downloaded the data set and opened it in Excel
2. I selected the entire data set and created a pivot table in a new worksheet
3. I dragged voting precinct to the rows section and offense to the values section
4. I finally sorted the rows by descending to figure out which precincts had the most offenses

**Answer:**
The D.C. precinct within one mile of AU's campus that handles the most crime is precinct 29 they have a count of 130 offenses. The precinct following is the 31st precinct with a 45 offense count.
